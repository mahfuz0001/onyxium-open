      </p>

        please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy
        policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily
        provided” information and “automatically collected” information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        “Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you
        knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated
        services.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        “Automatically collected” information refers to any information
        automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and
        its associated services.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Log Data</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you access our servers via our app, we may automatically log the
        standard data provided by your device. It may include your device's

        Additionally, when you encounter certain errors while using the app, we
        automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances
        surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details
        about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened,
        and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may
        not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that
        they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Please be aware that while this information may not be personally
        identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data

      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Types of Data Collected</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">

      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please be aware that any content you submit for the purpose of

      <p className="mb-4">
        We may collect, hold, use, and disclose information for the following
        purposes, and personal information will not be further processed in a
        manner that is incompatible with these purposes:

      </li>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal
        information with general information or research data we receive from
        other trusted sources. For example, If you consent to us accessing your
        social media profiles, we may combine information sourced from those
        profiles with information received from you directly to provide you with
        an enhanced experience of our app and services.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">
        Security of Your Personal Information
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain
        this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable
        means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access,
        disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you
        provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or
        storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security
        strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the
        bounds of our services. For example, ensuring any passwords associated
        with accessing your personal information and accounts are secure and
        confidential.

        We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This
        time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in
        accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided
        us with personal information as part of creating an account with us, we
        may retain this information for the duration your account exists on our
        system. If your personal information is no longer required for this
        purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details
        that identify you.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our

        research purposes or statistical purposes.
